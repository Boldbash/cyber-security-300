# Day 2: TCP Handshake & Port States

## 1. Technical Summary
- Studied the TCP Three-Way Handshake (SYN -> SYN-ACK -> ACK).
- Learned how TCP Flags (SYN, ACK, RST, FIN) control connection state.
- Explored how SYN Flood attacks exploit the "Half-Open" state to cause Denial of Service.

## 2. Hands-on Commands Used
- `nc -lvp 4444`: Created a manual TCP listener.
- `ss -tulpn`: Audited active network sockets and verified port status.
- `nc -v 127.0.0.1 4444`: Successfully established a local TCP connection.

## 3. Security Insight
The ability to identify "Listening" vs "Established" states is critical for detecting unauthorized backdoors. A port in 'LISTEN' state is an entry point; a connection in 'ESTABLISHED' state is an active conversation.
