# Day 1: Network Foundations (OSI & Protocols)

## 1. Technical Summary
- Analyzed the 7 layers of the OSI model through a security lens.
- Focused on Layer 2 (MAC/ARP) and Layer 3 (IP/Routing) as primary attack surfaces for internal networks.

## 2. Hands-on Commands Used
- `dig`: Investigated DNS records and headers.
- `ip route`: Identified the network gateway.
- `ip neighbor`: Mapped local MAC addresses to detect potential ARP conflicts.

## 3. Security Insight
Understood that a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack typically targets Layer 2 by poisoning the ARP cache, tricking the gateway into sending data to the attacker's MAC address.
